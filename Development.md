### Build

The build is intended to be as independent of XCode as humanly possible.

`make install` builds and installs both the App and Extension (everything).

### Releases

WavTap's installer is distributed via [Github Releases](https://github.com/pje/WavTap/releases/new).

Build the `pkg` bundler with PackageMaker.app, using Installer/WavTap.pmdoc

### Versioning

Strictly SemVer, obvi.

App package identifier: `com.wavtap.app.WavTap`
Extension package identifier: `com.wavtap.driver.WavTap`
